# Quote API
This is a quote API made by me in typescript, using express.js, and mongoose as a wrapper to interact with MongoDB

# Setup
Clone the repo, in the src folder, make a new file called `config.json` and enter content of the following format

```json
{"port": 5500, "mongo_url": "mongo db url here"}
```

- Now run `npm install` to install all of the dependencies.
- Make a new directory called `dist` where the code will be compiled.
- Now run `npm run build` to compile the code
- Now, finally, run `node dist/index.js` to start the project and enjoy!
